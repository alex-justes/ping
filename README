This is study program just to work out how works icmp-protocol. 
It is working ping program with some features:
    1) IP RECORD_ROUTE option.
    2) Different command-line args("./ping --help" for more info, or you can read it below)

This program contains few fragments from ping.c fron iputils package.
They are: 
    1) in_cksum function to calculate ip and icmp checksum
    2) "Some magic" to get source ip addr

Usage: ping [-c num] [-w time] [-q] [-D time]
            [-h] [-R] [-t] -d target

Description of command-line args:
    1) -c num --count num               -- Send $num probes
    2) -w time --time-to-wait time      -- How long we should wait after all probes sent to mark packet as losted. (It wait for a single echo_reply packet for $time in milliseconds, if $time expired it decides, that all packets with no echo_reply are lost, if even one echo_reply received, timeout restores and it wait for $time milliseconds again)
    3) -q --quit                        -- Don't produce any messages, except first line with "PING: target" and final statistics.
    4) -D time --delay time             -- How long we should wait before sending next probe in milliseconds
    5) -h --help                        -- Shows short help about usage and command-line args
    6) -R --record_route                -- Tells "ping" to add IP RECORD_ROUTE option in the IP header. (Note that only 9 ip's can be stored in the header)
    7) -t num --ttl num                 -- Sets ttl to $num
    8) -d target --destination target   -- Set target to ping. This arg is required!
